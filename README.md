# menthol
An application focused on minting and uploading NFTs for purchase on OpenSea.
Was originally written to work with Pinata, but was then modified to work with NFT.Storage.
Unfortunately, the code for the NFT.Storage version was lost to numerous OS reinstalls. (The code quality was a lot better the second time, I swear!)
